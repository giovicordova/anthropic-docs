# Project State

## Project Reference

Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-05 -- Completed 01-02 architecture decomposition

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 1)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Architecture refactor before features (monolith blocks testability and extensibility)
- Roadmap: Tests bundled with architecture phase (safety nets must exist before and during refactor)
- Roadmap: Phase 4 depends on Phase 1 only (not 2/3) -- content expansion needs ContentSource interface but not trust/freshness
- [Phase 01]: Crawl state tested via contract pattern since functions are private to index.ts
- [Phase 01]: Tool response formatting tested via pure helper functions replicating index.ts handler logic
- [Phase 01]: ContentSource.fetch receives db param so blogSource can call getIndexedBlogUrls for sitemap-diff
- [Phase 01]: Non-generation sources query total count from DB after insert (simpler than in-memory tracking)
- [Phase 01]: checkAndCrawlAll triggers crawlAll on first stale source (sequential all-or-nothing)
